# This file defines the default values used by various components in the default configuration layer
# of the servletsupport package. Be careful of not putting too many defaults here:

# The default publication name should _not_ be set. It defaults to an empty string so we can avoid NPEs but the
# filters actually check if the publication name is set to a non-empty string
# Technically this value is used by /com/escenic/servlet/PublicationResolverProcessor as ${/defaults.publication-name}
# publication-name=bt

# The forward defaults to /template/common.jsp.  Don't change this default value, since many templates may
# depend on the default being exactly this.
# Technically this value is used by /com/escenic/servlet/TemplateDispatchProcessor as ${/defaults.page}
forward-to-page=/template/common.jsp
